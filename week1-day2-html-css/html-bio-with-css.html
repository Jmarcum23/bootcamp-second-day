      <p>These days I spend my time doing what I love as the Creative Director at Scentco, Inc.  Myself, along with my team of 7 designers, help create the face for the Scentco, Inc. brand. Anywhere from the websites to the packaging you can usually find me brainstorming up some new idea to help move the company forward. My insatiable desire to design has also spilled over into my evenings on numerous freelance projects. I enjoy getting the opportunity to work with clients from different industries and markets. It helps keep my design both versatile and up to date. Prior to joining the Scentco, Inc. team I cut my teeth at the Art Institute of California â€“ San Diego.</p>
